◇ I’m interested in how to make AI more *'life-like'*.  
◇ Fields that I mainly have fun are **NLP** and **voice recognition/sysntehsis**.  
◇ I’m currently learning how to build language model(NLG) and use STT/TTS APIs.  
◇ I would be glad if there's any offer with the field that I mention above.  
◇ Here is my [Notion Resume](https://www.notion.so/Jae-Young-Suh-97352f16e3624766ba267fcc87bac966).
