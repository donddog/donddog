I am interested in **NLP(Natural Language Processing)** and **Speech**.  
Especially, I'm interested in **[Dialogue system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_system)** field.  
Currently, I'm participating in the project about making a voice agent for the social game.  
Related to the project, I studied how to apply a language model to generate sentence(NLG) and how to use STT(ASR)/TTS SDK for python.
