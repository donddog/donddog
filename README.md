◇ Fields that I am interested are **NLP** and **voice recognition/synthesis**.  
◇ I'm participating in the school project about making voice agent at the social game.  
◇ Related with the project, I currently study how to apply language model to generate sentence(NLG) and how to use STT/TTS APIs for ASR.  
◇ Here is my [Notion Resume](https://www.notion.so/Jae-Young-Suh-97352f16e3624766ba267fcc87bac966).
