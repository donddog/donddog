I am interested in the fields related to **NLP** or **voice recognition/synthesis**.  
Currently, I'm participating in the school project about making a voice agent for the social game.  
Related to the project, I studied how to apply a language model to generate sentence(NLG) and how to use STT(ASR)/TTS APIs/Platforms.
